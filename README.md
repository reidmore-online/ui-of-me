# UI of Me Project

I built this site as part of a project called "The UI of You", intended as an exploration of the symbols and properties that make up our perception of how we interact with the world around us. 

The inspiration for this came from the websites I used to build on the web in the early 2000's. Back then, the norm was table layouts and desktop-only screen sizes. In my development of this project, I decided to see whether I could recreate the look and feel of the websites from that time, but using more modern HTML and CSS techniques. This project works in a variety of viewports, and I have done my best to ensure it is also accessible, though there is likely more work to do. 

This project was completed for a course in OCADU's Inclusive Design Masters program, INCD 5001 Cognitive Semiotics. 

Images for this project were pulled from [SVG Repo](https://www.svgrepo.com/), and [Minitokyo](https://minitokyo.net).

JS for the tablist widget element was taken from [W3C ARIA Authoring Practices](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/tabs/examples/tabs-manual/) with some modification to adapt for different keyboard patterns.
